#Homework Project 

This is a homework projects combination. Each folder represents a project I done as a homework for a cetain lesson, usually Moocs. 

As this repository is used to as a reminder for me and a reference for people who are interested in a certain field, I would not mention which lesson a certain project belongs to.
